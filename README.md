# JavaScholarBackend | Academic Research & Data Analysis Tool

Server and Database Commands working with APIs

# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust, custom tool for academic research and data aggregation by leveraging specialized search APIs. The primary goal is to move beyond standard web search capabilities to extract structured, actionable data from scientific and scholarly databases, enabling deeper analysis of research trends, author networks, and citation metrics.

# Project Purpose
The main goal is to create a reliable and scalable platform that automates the process of gathering and structuring data from academic sources, providing researchers and analysts with enhanced tools for literature reviews and trend discovery.

# Key Functionalities
- Targeted Search: Execute specific, filtered searches against academic databases (like Google Scholar).
- Data Structuring: Convert raw API responses into structured formats (e.g., JSON or CSV) for easy database insertion and analysis.
- Trend Identification: Analyze collected data to identify emerging topics, influential authors, and citation patterns within a field.
- Visualization (Future): Implement data visualization to display search results, citation graphs, and academic connections clearly.

# Project Relevance
This project solves the problem of manual, time-consuming academic data collection. It facilitates efficient, large-scale literature reviews and provides quantitative data that is often difficult or impossible to obtain directly from public interfaces.
